# Introduction

In recent years, Korean society's political polarization has become the most significant social problem across generations, regions, and economic classes, Especially, regional differences in political orientation have become increasingly pronounced through recent major elections, prompting growing interest in the socio-economic factors that shape these divisions. This project explores how the economic level of the region is related to political choices by examining province-level income, GRDP, and vote outcomes from the 20th presidential election.The purpose is not to predict individual voting behavior, but to visually understand how the characteristics of the regional structure are reflected in the political landscape. By focusing on these relationships, the analysis aims to provide a clearer understanding of how economic disparities contribute to Korea’s growing political polarization.
