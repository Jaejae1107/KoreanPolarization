# Conclusion

This project examined whether various economic indicators, such as personal income, GRDP, and the ratio of income to GRDP, could explain the gap in conservative votes by region. However, all three indicators did not consistently predict political orientation, and the LOESS curve and low correlation coefficient showed that there was no clear systematic relationship between economic level and political orientation. Progressive and conservative tendencies were mixed in the income and GRDP quartiles, and the GRDP-income ratio, which represents the economic structure, was not linked to political patterns. These finding suggest that the regional political structure of Korea is more strongly rooted in non-economic factors such as historical experience, regional identity, and political memory than in economic factors. However, this study has a limitation in that it was not possible to use age and individual-level data due to the secret ballot principle, and that the analysis had to be performed only at the level of regional aggregation. Future studies require multidimensional analysis beyond economic variables, such as quantifying historical and cultural factors or establishing regional identity indicators. Through this investigation, I learned that real social phenomena are difficult to explain as a single factor, without capturing a sufficiently broad set of variables, it becomes extremely difficult to detect meaningful patterns or correlations, underscoring the inherent complexity of political and socioeconomic behavior.
