Especially, the difference in political orientation by age group has become more pronounced through repeated elections and political issues, which causes social disconnection and conflict. This study aims to more systematically understand this polarization phenomenon by exploring the correlation between income levels by region and voting propensity by age group. In addition, I aim to visually examine how political choices vary by generation in regions with different economic backgrounds. Through this, by analyzing data, not only find “who supports which party.”, but understand what social and economic conditions Korea’s political division is formed and strengthened.",
