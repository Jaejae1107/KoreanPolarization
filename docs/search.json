    "text": "1 Introduction\nIn recent years, Korean society’s political polarization has become the most significant social problem across generations, regions, and economic classes, Especially, regional differences in political orientation have become increasingly pronounced through recent major elections, prompting growing interest in the socio-economic factors that shape these divisions. This project explores how the economic level of the region is related to political choices by examining province-level income, GRDP, and vote outcomes from the 20th presidential election.The purpose is not to predict individual voting behavior, but to visually understand how the characteristics of the regional structure are reflected in the political landscape. By focusing on these relationships, the analysis aims to provide a clearer understanding of how economic disparities contribute to Korea’s growing political polarization.",

    "text": "2.1 Description\nThis project draws on three official data sources collected and managed by the government agencies in South Korea. Economic indicators come from the Korean Statistical Information Service (KOSIS) operated by Statistics Korea, which annually publishes province-level per capita GRDP and per capita personal income derived from administrative records and national accounts procedures. These datasets are provided in CSV format, updated once a year, containing 17 rows (one for each province) and a single numeric variable per file. Political data is the result of the counting of the 20th presidential election in 2022 provided by the National Election Commission (NEC), and the original Excel data is composed of voting districts and is confirmed after the election, and in this study, it was aggregated at the city/province level for combination with economic data. All three data are freely accessible and well documented online, and no missing values or structural problems were found during the pre-processing process. Due to the secret voting principle, there is no data on voting propensity at the age and individual levels, so this project conducts an analysis based on summary statistics at the regional level. The exact files used are provided in the project repository for full reproducibility.\nAlso, the data has been preprocessed, and the merged dataset contains province-level economic indicators and election results used throughout this analysis. The key variables are defined as follows:\nEconomic Variables\nPolitical Variables\nRegional Variables\nThese variables collectively enable the exploration of whether economic conditions or economic structure meaningfully relate to regional voting patterns in South Korea.",

As shown in the graph, all variables have missing values of 0, which means that there are no missing data were detected across any of the 17 provinces.\nThis result indicates that the dataset is fully complete and does not require imputation or row removal before analysis. Since economic indicators from KOSIS and election results from the NEC are standardized administrative records, the absence of missingness is expected.The completed data structure ensures that subsequent visualization and correlation analysis are not distorted by missing data, and there is an advantage in that information from all 17 cities and provinces can be used without a separate correction or deletion procedure.\n\n\nCode\nmissing_matrix &lt;- prov %&gt;%\n  mutate(across(everything(), as.character)) %&gt;%\n  pivot_longer(\n    cols = -province,\n    names_to = \"variable\",\n    values_to = \"value\"\n  ) %&gt;%\n  mutate(\n    is_missing = if_else(is.na(value) | value == \"\", \"Missing\", \"Observed\")\n  )\n\nggplot(missing_matrix, aes(x = variable, y = province, fill = is_missing)) +\n  geom_tile(color = \"white\") +\n  scale_fill_manual(\n    values = c(\"Observed\" = \"#4daf4a\", \"Missing\" = \"#e41a1c\")\n  ) +\n  labs(\n    x = \"Variable\",\n    y = \"Province\",\n    fill = NULL\n  ) +\n  theme_minimal(base_size = 16) +\n  theme(\n    axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 30, hjust = 1)\n  )\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 2.2: Missingness matrix: each cell indicates whether a value is observed or missing.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe second plot presents a missingness heatmap that visually shows whether each value has been observed for 17 provinces (row) and all variables (column) in the dataset. Each cell represents a specific province-variable pair, and green indicates that there is a value (Observed). Since the entire graph is uniformly filled with green, it demonstrates that there are no missing observations for any variable or region, and no localized or variable-specific missingness patterns are present.\nThis visual confirmation aligns with the previous missing value summary statistics and reflects the characteristic that structural missing does not occur as both the economic indicators (KOSIS) and election results (NEC) used in the analysis are official data collected based on administrative procedures. The absence of missing values eliminates the possibility of sample loss or bias in all subsequent analysis stages, such as visualization, correlation analysis, and regional comparison, and shows that the entire dataset can be used as it is.\nData Sources\n\nNational Election Commission (NEC): https://info.nec.go.kr/\nKorean Statistical Information Service (KOSIS): https://kosis.kr/eng/",

This arrangement is not a problem of data loss or visual gap, but it’s a result that naturally occurs in the aggregate characteristics of city/province data and the spatial scale of administrative districts, and is also suitable for clearly showing comparisons between regions in subsequent analysis.\nCode\n# Income color palette\nincome_pal &lt;- colorNumeric(\n  palette = \"YlOrRd\",\n  domain = prov_map$income_2023,\n  reverse = TRUE\n)\n\n# Create map with scaled circles\nleaflet(prov_map) %&gt;%\n  addProviderTiles(providers$CartoDB.Positron) %&gt;%\n  addCircleMarkers(\n    lng = ~lon,\n    lat = ~lat,\n    radius = ~sqrt(total_votes) / 150,  # Scale by voters\n    fillColor = ~income_pal(income_2023),\n    fillOpacity = 0.8,\n    color = \"#333333\",\n    weight = 2,\n    opacity = 1,\n    popup = ~paste0(\n      \"&lt;div style='padding: 12px; font-family: Arial; min-width: 250px;'&gt;\",\n      \"&lt;h3 style='margin: 0 0 10px; color: #2c3e50; border-bottom: 2px solid #3498db;'&gt;\", \n      province, \"&lt;/h3&gt;\",\n      \"&lt;table style='width: 100%; font-size: 14px;'&gt;\",\n      \"&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;b&gt;💰 Income&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td style='text-align: right;'&gt;&lt;b&gt;₩\", \n        format(income_2023, big.mark = \",\"), \"K&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;\",\n      \"&lt;tr style='background: #f8f9fa;'&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;b&gt;🏭 GRDP&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td style='text-align: right;'&gt;₩\", \n        format(grdp_2023, big.mark = \",\"), \"K&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;\",\n      \"&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;b&gt;👥 Voters&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td style='text-align: right;'&gt;\", \n        format(total_votes, big.mark = \",\"), \"&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;\",\n      \"&lt;tr style='background: #f8f9fa;'&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;b&gt;📊 GRDP/Income&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td style='text-align: right;'&gt;\", \n        round(grdp_income_ratio, 2), \"×&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;\",\n      \"&lt;/table&gt;\",\n      \"&lt;/div&gt;\"\n    ),\n    label = ~province,\n    labelOptions = labelOptions(\n      style = list(\"font-weight\" = \"bold\", \"font-size\" = \"14px\"),\n      direction = \"auto\",\n      offset = c(0, -10)\n    )\n  ) %&gt;%\n  addLegend(\n    \"bottomright\",\n    pal = income_pal,\n    values = ~income_2023,\n    title = \"Per Capita Income&lt;br/&gt;(₩1,000)\",\n    opacity = 0.8,\n    labFormat = labelFormat(big.mark = \",\")\n  ) %&gt;%\n  setView(lng = 127.7, lat = 36.5, zoom = 7)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 3.1: Per capita income by province: circle size shows total voters, color shows income level\nGeographic pattern clear: The map reveals a clear geographical pattern at the income level of each region in Korea. Especially, the northwest cluster, which is the metropolitan area centered on Seoul and Gyeonggi shows the highest per capita income and the large number of voters at the same time, showing bright colors and large circles. Ulsan stands out as a high-income industrial city along the southeastern coast, distinct from neighboring areas. In contrast, Gangwon Jeolla region, and some southern Gyeongsang areas are marked with relatively dark colors and small circles, indicating that the income level is low and the population size is small. Since the size of the circle is proportional to the number of voters, Seoul and major cities are particularly large, and it can be seen that the distribution of population and economic concentration appear spatially together.\nCode\n# Political color palette\nvoting_pal &lt;- colorNumeric(\n  palette = c(\"#053061\", \"#2166ac\", \"#4393c3\", \"#92c5de\", \"#d1e5f0\",\n              \"#f7f7f7\",\n              \"#fddbc7\", \"#f4a582\", \"#d6604d\", \"#b2182b\", \"#67001f\"),\n  domain = c(-80, 60)\n)\n\n# Create voting map\nleaflet(prov_map) %&gt;%\n  addProviderTiles(providers$CartoDB.Positron) %&gt;%\n  addCircleMarkers(\n    lng = ~lon,\n    lat = ~lat,\n    radius = ~sqrt(total_votes) / 150,\n    fillColor = ~voting_pal(conservative_margin),\n    fillOpacity = 0.85,\n    color = \"#333333\",\n    weight = 2,\n    opacity = 1,\n    popup = ~paste0(\n      \"&lt;div style='padding: 12px; font-family: Arial; min-width: 280px;'&gt;\",\n      \"&lt;h3 style='margin: 0 0 10px; color: #2c3e50; border-bottom: 2px solid \",\n        ifelse(conservative_margin &gt; 0, \"#e74c3c\", \"#3498db\"), \";'&gt;\", \n        province, \"&lt;/h3&gt;\",\n      \"&lt;table style='width: 100%; font-size: 14px;'&gt;\",\n      \"&lt;tr style='background: #e3f2fd;'&gt;&lt;td style='padding: 6px;'&gt;&lt;b&gt;🔵 Lee Jae-myung&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/td&gt;\",\n        \"&lt;td style='text-align: right; padding: 6px;'&gt;&lt;b&gt;\", round(lee_pct, 1), \"%&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;\",\n      \"&lt;tr style='background: #ffebee;'&gt;&lt;td style='padding: 6px;'&gt;&lt;b&gt;🔴 Yoon Seok-youl&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/td&gt;\",\n        \"&lt;td style='text-align: right; padding: 6px;'&gt;&lt;b&gt;\", round(yoon_pct, 1), \"%&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;\",\n      \"&lt;tr style='border-top: 2px solid #ddd;'&gt;&lt;td style='padding: 6px;'&gt;&lt;b&gt;📊 Margin&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/td&gt;\",\n        \"&lt;td style='text-align: right; padding: 6px; font-weight: bold; font-size: 16px; color: \",\n        ifelse(conservative_margin &gt; 0, \"#b2182b\", \"#2166ac\"), \";'&gt;\",\n        ifelse(conservative_margin &gt; 0, \"+\", \"\"),\n        round(conservative_margin, 1), \" pp&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;\",\n      \"&lt;tr style='background: #f8f9fa;'&gt;&lt;td style='padding: 6px;'&gt;Total Votes&lt;/td&gt;\",\n        \"&lt;td style='text-align: right; padding: 6px;'&gt;\", \n        format(total_votes, big.mark = \",\"), \"&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;\",\n      \"&lt;/table&gt;\",\n      \"&lt;/div&gt;\"\n    ),\n    label = ~paste0(province, \": \", ifelse(conservative_margin &gt; 0, \"+\", \"\"), \n                   round(conservative_margin, 1), \"pp\"),\n    labelOptions = labelOptions(\n      style = list(\"font-weight\" = \"bold\", \"font-size\" = \"14px\"),\n      direction = \"auto\",\n      offset = c(0, -10)\n    )\n  ) %&gt;%\n  addLegend(\n    \"bottomright\",\n    pal = voting_pal,\n    values = c(-80, 60),\n    title = \"Political Lean&lt;br/&gt;(Yoon - Lee)\",\n    opacity = 0.85,\n    labFormat = labelFormat(suffix = \" pp\")\n  ) %&gt;%\n  setView(lng = 127.7, lat = 36.5, zoom = 7)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 3.2: 2022 Presidential Election—political lean by province.

In contrast, the southeastern regions such as Daegu, Gyeongbuk, Gyeongnam, Busan, and Ulsan appear in dark red, revealing a strong conservative dominance. The capital region such as Seoul, Incheon, and Gyeonggi are marked with relatively light colors, indicating that the competition between the two candidates was much fiercer.

Seoul stand out as the highest income at about ₩29.4 million, while Gyeongnam has the lowest income at about ₩22.8 million, reaching a gap of about 29%. High income regions such as Ulsan, Daejeon, Sejong, and Gyeonggi are located at the top of the distribution, reflecting the concentration of economic activity in urban areas and a relatively higher paying industries. In contrast, several rural provinces, such as Gangwon, Gyeongbuk, Jeju, and Gyeongnam, are clustered in the lower part, indicating the economic hierarchy between regions. This continuous pattern of income decline is not just a coincidence but due to structural differences between metropolitan and industrial centers and the surrounding areas, showing how Korea’s spatial economic structure is reflected in the income gap by region.\n\n\nCode\ncor_val &lt;- cor(prov$income_2023, prov$grdp_2023)\n\nprov %&gt;%\n  ggplot(aes(x = income_2023, y = grdp_2023)) +\n  geom_point(\n    aes(size = lee_votes + yoon_votes, color = conservative_margin),\n    alpha = 0.7\n  ) +\n  geom_smooth(method = \"lm\", se = TRUE, color = \"darkblue\", \n              fill = \"lightblue\", alpha = 0.2, linewidth = 1) +\n  geom_text_repel(\n    aes(label = province),\n    size = 3.5,\n    max.overlaps = 20\n  ) +\n  scale_size_continuous(\n    name = \"Total votes\",\n    labels = label_comma(),\n    range = c(3, 12)\n  ) +\n  scale_color_gradient2(\n    low = \"#4a90e2\",\n    mid = \"gray80\",\n    high = \"#e74c3c\",\n    midpoint = 0,\n    name = \"Conservative\\nmargin\"\n  ) +\n  scale_x_continuous(labels = label_comma()) +\n  scale_y_continuous(labels = label_comma()) +\n  labs(\n    title = \"GRDP vs. Income: Production and living standards diverge\",\n    subtitle = sprintf(\"Correlation: r = %.2f\", cor_val),\n    x = \"Per-capita income (thousands of won)\",\n    y = \"Per-capita GRDP (thousands of won)\"\n  ) +\n  theme_minimal(base_size = 14) +\n  theme(\n    plot.title = element_text(face = \"bold\", size = 16),\n    legend.position = \"right\"\n  )\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 3.4: GRDP and income show a modest positive correlation (r = 0.46).\n\n\n\n\n\nThe scatterplot compares the relationship between per-capita GRDP and per-capita income for each province, and shows that the regional “production level” and “living standard” only partially coincide. Overall, the higher the income, the higher the GRDP, but regions located large above the trend line, such as Ulsan and Chungnam, are representative examples of inconsistencies in which industrial production is very high compared to the income level of the residents. Conversely, regions with relatively low production scale, such as Gwangju and Jeonbuk, are located below the trend line, suggesting more modest production relative to income. In addition, the bubble size reflects the total number of votes in the region, and the metropolitan areas such as Seoul and Gyeonggi province appear large, and the color represents the degree of dominance of the conservative vote, so political orientation by region is visualized. Through this plot, Korea’s economic geography cannot be reduced to a single dimension that some regions are “production rich” without being equally “income rich,” and these differences interact with both population size and political orientation.",

A 50% baseline in the center of the graph shows that no region showed a competitive structure close to 50:50, and all cities and provinces are clearly inclined toward one candidate. Honam region (Jeonnam, Gwangju, Jeonbuk) overwhelmingly supported progressive candidates, while Yeongnam region (Daegu, Gyeongbuk, and Gyeongnam) showed high support for conservative candidates. Even in the capital area such as Seoul, Incheon, and Gyeonggi Province, it seems to be balanced, but in reality, there is a clear difference. These results visually confirm that Korea’s regional political orientation is not an accidental change, but is structurally fixed, and that each region has a distinct ideological direction.\n\n\nCode\nprov %&gt;%\n  mutate(province = fct_reorder(province, conservative_margin)) %&gt;%\n  ggplot(aes(x = province, y = conservative_margin, fill = conservative_win)) +\n  geom_col(width = 0.7) +\n  geom_hline(yintercept = 0, color = \"black\", linewidth = 1) +\n  geom_text(\n    aes(label = sprintf(\"%+.1f\", conservative_margin)),\n    hjust = ifelse(prov$conservative_margin &gt; 0, -0.1, 1.1),\n    size = 3.5,\n    fontface = \"bold\"\n  ) +\n  scale_fill_manual(\n    values = c(\n      \"Progressive-leaning\" = \"#4a90e2\",\n      \"Conservative-leaning\" = \"#e74c3c\"\n    )\n  ) +\n  scale_y_continuous(labels = label_number(suffix = \" pp\")) +\n  coord_flip() +\n  labs(\n    title = \"129-point spread dwarfs the 0.73pp national margin\",\n    x = NULL,\n    y = \"Conservative advantage (percentage points)\",\n    fill = NULL\n  ) +\n  theme_minimal(base_size = 14) +\n  theme(\n    panel.grid.major.y = element_blank(),\n    plot.title = element_text(face = \"bold\", size = 16),\n    legend.position = \"top\"\n  )\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 3.6: 129 percentage point spread from Jeonnam (-75pp) to Daegu (+54pp).\n\n\n\n\n\nThe chart visualizes the ‘conservative vote advantage’ of each region in the 2022 presidential election, and shows at a glance how extremely wide ideological divide. From Jeonnam (–74.7pp) to Daegu (+53.5pp), there is a total gap of 129 points, and it can be seen that there was virtually no competitive region as neither single region was close to zero. Honam (Jeonnam, Gwangju, and Jeonbuk) is the strongest progressive dominant region in the country, while Yeongnam (Daegu, Gyeongbuk, and Gyeongnam) is the strongest conservative dominant region. Although the capital areas such as Seoul, Gyeonggi, and Incheon are relatively close to the center, there are still clear deviations.

The LOESS curve shows a weak increase in conservative tendencies in Seoul and Ulsan, where the income is highest, but the overall pattern is difficult to be linear. Jeonnam, Gwangju, and Jeonbuk, which have the middle income level, show strong progressive tendencies, and some low-income regions appear conservatively, forming a U-shaped distribution. This U-shapped pattern suggests that korea’s income levels do not consistently explain political orientation, and that regional identity and historical political structure have a greater influence on voting behavior. In addition, the size of the bubble visually reveals the high election influence of the capital region (Seoul and Gyeonggi) by reflecting the size of the population.\n\n\nCode\nprov %&gt;%\n  mutate(\n    income_q = cut(\n      income_2023,\n      breaks = quantile(income_2023, probs = seq(0, 1, 0.25)),\n      labels = c(\"Q1 (Lowest)\", \"Q2\", \"Q3\", \"Q4 (Highest)\"),\n      include.lowest = TRUE\n    )\n  ) %&gt;%\n  ggplot(aes(x = income_q, y = conservative_margin)) +\n  geom_boxplot(fill = \"lightgray\", alpha = 0.5, outlier.shape = NA, width = 0.5) +\n  geom_jitter(\n    aes(size = lee_votes + yoon_votes, color = conservative_margin),\n    width = 0.15,\n    alpha = 0.7\n  ) +\n  geom_hline(yintercept = 0, linetype = \"dashed\", color = \"black\") +\n  scale_color_gradient2(\n    low = \"#4a90e2\",\n    mid = \"gray80\",\n    high = \"#e74c3c\",\n    midpoint = 0,\n    guide = \"none\"\n  ) +\n  scale_size_continuous(\n    name = \"Total votes\",\n    labels = label_comma(),\n    range = c(3, 10)\n  ) +\n  scale_y_continuous(labels = label_number(suffix = \" pp\")) +\n  labs(\n    title = \"Conservative vote margins across four per-capita income quartiles\",\n    x = \"Per-capita income quartile\",\n    y = \"Conservative margin\"\n  ) +\n  theme_minimal(base_size = 14) +\n  theme(\n    plot.title = element_text(face = \"bold\", size = 16),\n    legend.position = \"right\"\n  )\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 3.8: Conservative vote margins across four per-capita income quartiles.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe boxplot reveals that the relationship between income and conservative tendencies is not a linear pattern in which higher income simply leads to stronger conservatism. In particular, in the lowest income quartile (Q1), the most conservative regions such as Daegu, Gyeongbuk, and Gyeongnam are concentrated, showing a strong conservative tendency. In contrast, the middle income group (Q2, Q3) has the largest distribution from strong progressive regions such as Jeonnam, Gwangju, and Jeonbuk to conservative regions, and thus has great ideological diversity. The highest income quartile (Q4) shows a weak conservative tendency on average, but is much weaker than the strong conservative advantage shown in Q1. This U-shaped pattern suggests that the simply interpretation that ‘the higher the income, the more conservative’ is not established, that the lowest and highest income groups show conservative tendencies for different reasons, and that the middle income group has the most mixed ideological structure, including the progressive and strong regions.",

The LOESS curve is generally flat and shows only slight local fluctuations, and the correlation coefficient is also very weak (r ≈ 0.06). High GRDP provinces such as Ulsan do not consistently vote conservative, while low-GRDP regions such as Daegu exhibit strong conservative tendencies, and patterns that contradict a simple “wealthier regions vote conservative” explanation. This emphasizes that both income and GRDP have very weak power to explain voting propensity, and it is difficult to understand regional political propensity only by economic factors. This suggests that Korea’s voting pattern is more affected by regional identity and historical factors than by economic level.\n\n\nCode\nprov %&gt;%\n  mutate(\n    grdp_q = cut(\n      grdp_2023,\n      breaks = quantile(grdp_2023, probs = seq(0, 1, 0.25)),\n      labels = c(\"Q1 (Lowest)\", \"Q2\", \"Q3\", \"Q4 (Highest)\"),\n      include.lowest = TRUE\n    )\n  ) %&gt;%\n  ggplot(aes(x = grdp_q, y = conservative_margin)) +\n  geom_boxplot(fill = \"lightgray\", alpha = 0.5, outlier.shape = NA, width = 0.5) +\n  geom_jitter(\n    aes(size = lee_votes + yoon_votes, color = conservative_margin),\n    width = 0.15,\n    alpha = 0.7\n  ) +\n  geom_hline(yintercept = 0, linetype = \"dashed\", color = \"black\") +\n  scale_color_gradient2(\n    low = \"#4a90e2\",\n    mid = \"gray80\",\n    high = \"#e74c3c\",\n    midpoint = 0,\n    guide = \"none\"\n  ) +\n  scale_size_continuous(\n    name = \"Total votes\",\n    labels = label_comma(),\n    range = c(3, 10)\n  ) +\n  scale_y_continuous(labels = label_number(suffix = \" pp\")) +\n  labs(\n    title = \"Conservative vote margins across four per-capita GRDP quartiles\",\n    x = \"Per-capita GRDP quartile\",\n    y = \"Conservative margin\"\n  ) +\n  theme_minimal(base_size = 14) +\n  theme(\n    plot.title = element_text(face = \"bold\", size = 16),\n    legend.position = \"right\"\n  )\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 3.10: Conservative vote margins across four per-capita GRDP quartiles.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe boxplot compares the gap between conservative votes by dividing the per-capita GRDP into four quartiles, and shows that there is no clear relationship between the GRDP level and conservative tendency. Even within the lowest GRDP group (Q1), strong conservative regions (Daegu and Gyeongbuk) and strong progressive regions (Gwangju and Jeonnam) exist at the same time, and there is no consistent pattern in Q2 and Q3 due to a mixture of conservative and progressive tendencies. Even in Q4, which has the highest GRDP, the conservative vote rate does not show a constant increase or decrease, and the distribution range between regions is very diverse. Overall, since all four quartiles do not show significant changes in conservative tendencies or predictable directions, the regional economic output level (GRDP) has little influence in explaining Korea’s regional political orientation, and the political pattern supports the conclusion that it is more determined by regional identity and historical factors than by economic structure.",

    "text": "This project examined whether various economic indicators, such as personal income, GRDP, and the ratio of income to GRDP, could explain the gap in conservative votes by region. However, all three indicators did not consistently predict political orientation, and the LOESS curve and low correlation coefficient showed that there was no clear systematic relationship between economic level and political orientation. Progressive and conservative tendencies were mixed in the income and GRDP quartiles, and the GRDP-income ratio, which represents the economic structure, was not linked to political patterns. These finding suggest that the regional political structure of Korea is more strongly rooted in non-economic factors such as historical experience, regional identity, and political memory than in economic factors. However, this study has a limitation in that it was not possible to use age and individual-level data due to the secret ballot principle, and that the analysis had to be performed only at the level of regional aggregation. Future studies require multidimensional analysis beyond economic variables, such as quantifying historical and cultural factors or establishing regional identity indicators. Through this investigation, I learned that real social phenomena are difficult to explain as a single factor, without capturing a sufficiently broad set of variables, it becomes extremely difficult to detect meaningful patterns or correlations, underscoring the inherent complexity of political and socioeconomic behavior.",

The ratio is spread out from about 1.1 to 2.0, but strong conservative areas and strong progressive areas are mixed and distributed throughout the section. For example, Daegu and Gyeongbuk, which have very strong conservative tendencies, and Gwangju and Jeonnam, which have very strong progressive tendencies, are all located near 1.3 to 1.5, and Ulsan and Chungnam, which have high ratios, are also close to the middle level rather than overwhelming conservatism. The fact that there is no clear gradient of color (conservative gap) along the vertical axis means that even regions with similar economic structures may have very different political tendencies. Along with the previous income and GRDP analysis, neither income level nor production structure strongly explain Korea’s regional voting patterns, supporting the interpretation that regional identity and historical factors play a much more important role.",
